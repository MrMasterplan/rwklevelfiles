Looking a bit more at the .sav files, I have made some observations:
- Standard level save-games are presen with full regular level grid and map
- I tried sharing a level which had a level in it, to see of the level would
  appear in the map. I thought maybe I could find a value for a reverse lever.
  The level grid was empty where the lever should have been.
   - BUT: The map had values of 99(dec) in de map where the emptiness was.
    Maybe I should expore that as a "forbidden" map value. (Actually it is possible
     to use the coin map tile for that.)
