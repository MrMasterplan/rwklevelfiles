# On painting springs

It seems that the sequence 3d000300 is a spring top, and the secquence 3d000100 is a spring shaft.
I probably need to add spring paint.

Though: Maybe the springiness bit 0x00000200 is globally reserved in the paint encoding.
Also, the MSbyte is probably a counter, except it cannot be zero.
