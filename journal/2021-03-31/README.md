I just realized that I can get enormous speedup of the fuzzer.
Not only are there many more cells that can be photographed,
I can also just upload more levels and then go through them in-game,
thus saving me from the startup delay.
All together I should be able to go from 5 seconds per tile to maybe
5 ms per tile, a speedup of up to 1000.

Then I really just need to figure out the robot and kitty positions.


Major update: Much faster
