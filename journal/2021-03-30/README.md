I wrote a fuzzer that will basically put an unknown tile into the game
and photograph them individually to find out what the look is.
It is very slow to start the game and therefore this process takes a long
time. It could be accelerated by about a factor of 10 to 50 if more cells 
are placed into the level being photographed, but that woudl be more coding.
No documentation for now. You will just need to figure it out, or wait for
another day. :)
