# RWK Level Editor

Here I am making the level editor.
The actual editor is "Tiled" (https://www.mapeditor.org/) so go ahead and install it.
In this folder there will be
- tilesets for making RWK maps
- scripts to grab those tiles from the game (images are not bundled for copyright reasons)
- Tiled editor map templates for making your levels
- tools for the Tiled editor to check your map for consistency
- scripts to convert your Tiled map into RWK .kitty files and pushing them into the online game.
