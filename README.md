# RWKlevelfiles

Welcome to the fan-made editor for Robot-wants-kitty levels!

- Non technical users should start with the [Manual Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
- Technical users can read the [full instructions](docs/ADVANCED.md)
- Once you have the setup, [read how to make levels](docs/MAKING_LEVELS.md)

# Quick Start

The quickest way to get started is to get the
[Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and then to unpack the
folder `rwk` from the 
[release area](https://github.com/mrmasterplan/rwklevelfiles/releases)
into the extensions folder of Tiled (Edit ➔ Preferences ➔ Plugins ➔ Open...).
You can now use Tiled to edit `.kitty` files that you backed up into your iCloud.

Was that too fast? No problem, go read the full [Getting-Started Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).
